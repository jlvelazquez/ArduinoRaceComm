# ArduinoRaceComm
Arduino computer for endurance racing

W O R K I N P R O G R E S S   

This Arduino project implements an easy-to-use, lowcost communication system between driver and box team.

Future developments will take this to a full race computer system for data logging and beyond.

# Arduino components and modules

- Arduino Mega
- LCD Display 16x2 + potentiometer to set lcd brightness
- GSM Module (SIM 800L)
- Joystick
- Momentary buttons
- A cool enclosure. This computer has to be practical and cool.
- Batteries. First version will use a power bank for Arduino Mega connected to USB port (5V - 500mA) and a LiPo 1S (3.7V) for the GSM Module. The initial idea is to make a 100% portable version. Future implementations will be able to connect to car lighter or directly to the 12V car battery. Estimated operating time with 9000mAh is more than 30 hours in "normal use".
